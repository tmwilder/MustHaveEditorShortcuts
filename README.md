# MustHaveEditorShortcuts
Editor shortcuts not to leave home without

## Motivation

I've seen a huge difference in productive output on a few simple editor tricks for programmers. 

How we navigate our code is often a key limiter to productivity. Finding things quickly lowers time, well, finding things.

This can have a non-linear boost beyond just saving search time because it prevents mental context swapping.

## Use

Open up the repo, figure out how to keyboard shortcut the following in your editor. It's important to keyboard shortcut
rather than menu select to really realize the benefits.

## Shortcuts

1. Fuzzy file find: Find a file based on a partial string match by starting to type in characters.
2. Fuzzy symbol match: (1) but for functions, classnames, etc...
3. Go to definition: You should be able to hit this and go to where a function, variable, class, etc... is defined.
4. Cursor stack back: Go to prior cursor location.
5. Cursor stack foward: Undo go to prior cursor location. Very synergistic with 4) since you can now move up and down a method call chain.
6. Full repository text scan.
